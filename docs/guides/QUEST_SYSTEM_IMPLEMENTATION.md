## Overview

The Quest/Mission System has been successfully implemented as the first high-priority feature from the roadmap. The system provides structured gameplay goals, progression tracking, and rewards for players.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Quest UI System ✅

**File:** `AvorionLike/Core/UI/QuestLogUI.cs` (444 lines)

**Features:**
- **Quest Log Window** - Full-featured quest management interface
  - Press [J] to toggle quest log
  - Tabbed interface: Active, Available, Completed, All
  - Two-column layout: Quest list + Quest details
  - Visual status indicators with color coding
  - Quest filtering and selection
  - Action buttons (Accept, Abandon, Turn In)
  
- **Objective Tracker Overlay** - Heads-up display for active quests
  - Top-right corner overlay
  - Shows up to 3 active quests with their objectives
  - Real-time progress tracking
  - Time remaining display for timed quests
  - Clean, minimalist design

**Color Scheme:**
- 🔵 Cyan - Active quests
- 🟢 Green - Completed objectives/quests  
- 🔴 Red - Failed quests/expired timers
- 🟡 Yellow - Available quests
- ⚪ Light gray - Regular objectives
- ⚫ Gray - Optional objectives

### 2. Game Engine Integration ✅

**Modified Files:**
- `AvorionLike/Core/GameEngine.cs`
- `AvorionLike/Core/Graphics/GraphicsWindow.cs`
- `AvorionLike/Program.cs`

**Changes:**
- Quest templates loaded from `GameData/Quests/` at engine initialization
- Quest UI integrated into graphics rendering pipeline
- Player entity automatically receives QuestComponent on creation
- Tutorial quest ("First Steps: Mining") auto-assigned to new players
- [J] key binding for quest log toggle

### 3. Testing Console Commands ✅

**File:** `AvorionLike/Core/DevTools/InGameTestingConsole.cs`

**New Commands:**
- `quest_list` - List all available quest templates
- `quest_give <questId>` - Give a specific quest to player
- `quest_progress` - Show player's current quest progress
- `quest_complete [questId]` - Instantly complete quest objectives (for testing)

### 4. Sample Quest Content ✅

**Location:** `GameData/Quests/`

**Quests Created:**
1. **tutorial_mining.json** - First Steps: Mining (Already existed)
   - Mine 100 Iron ore
   - Rewards: 1,000 Credits, 50 XP
   - Tutorial quest, auto-assigned

2. **combat_pirates.json** - Clear the Sector (Already existed)
   - Destroy 5 pirate ships
   - Rewards: 5,000 Credits, 200 XP, +10 Reputation
   - Repeatable, 1-hour time limit

3. **explore_sector.json** - First Explorer (NEW)
   - Visit 3 different sectors
   - Rewards: 2,000 Credits, 100 XP
   - Tutorial quest

4. **build_ship.json** - Ship Builder (NEW)

---

## How It Works

### Quest Loading Flow
1. Game engine initializes
2. `LoadQuestTemplates()` scans `GameData/Quests/*.json`
3. Quest templates added to `QuestSystem`
4. Templates ready for instantiation

### Player Quest Flow
1. Player creates new game
2. `CreatePlayerPod()` adds `QuestComponent` to player entity
3. Tutorial quest automatically given via `QuestSystem.GiveQuest()`
4. Quest appears in objective tracker and quest log

### Quest Progression
1. Player performs actions (mining, combat, etc.)
2. Game systems publish events (ResourceMined, EntityDestroyed, etc.)
3. `QuestSystem` listens for events and progresses objectives
4. When objectives complete, quest status updates
5. Player can turn in completed quests for rewards
