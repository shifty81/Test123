## Usage

### Creating a Pod
```csharp
var pod = entityManager.CreateEntity("Player Pod");
var podComponent = new PlayerPodComponent
{
    EntityId = pod.Id,
    BaseEfficiencyMultiplier = 0.5f,
    MaxUpgradeSlots = 5
};
entityManager.AddComponent(pod.Id, podComponent);

// Add skill tree
var skillTree = new PodSkillTreeComponent { EntityId = pod.Id };
entityManager.AddComponent(pod.Id, skillTree);

// Add abilities
var abilities = new PodAbilitiesComponent { EntityId = pod.Id };
entityManager.AddComponent(pod.Id, abilities);
```

### Learning Skills
```csharp
int skillPoints = progressionComponent.SkillPoints;
bool learned = skillTree.LearnSkill("combat_weapon_damage", 
                                     progressionComponent.Level, 
                                     ref skillPoints);
progressionComponent.SkillPoints = skillPoints;
```

### Equipping Abilities
```csharp
abilitiesComponent.EquipAbility("shield_overcharge");
abilitiesComponent.EquipAbility("afterburner");
abilitiesComponent.EquipAbility("overload_weapons");
```

### Using Abilities
```csharp
float availableEnergy = podComponent.GetTotalPowerGeneration(skillTree);
bool used = abilitiesComponent.UseAbility("afterburner", availableEnergy);
```

### Equipping Upgrades
```csharp
var upgrade = new PodUpgrade(
    "Advanced Thruster Module",
    "Increases thrust power by 25N",
    PodUpgradeType.ThrustBoost,
    25f,
    3 // Rarity
);
podComponent.EquipUpgrade(upgrade);
```

### Docking to a Ship
```csharp
// Ship needs a DockingComponent
var dockingComponent = new DockingComponent
{
    EntityId = shipId,
    HasDockingPort = true
};
entityManager.AddComponent(shipId, dockingComponent);

// Dock the pod
bool success = podDockingSystem.DockPod(podId, shipId);

// Get effective stats (includes all bonuses)
var stats = podDockingSystem.GetEffectiveShipStats(shipId);
```

### Generating Loot
```csharp
// Generate loot with pod upgrades
var loot = lootSystem.GenerateLoot(enemyLevel, includePodLoot: true);

// Process loot and collect upgrades
var foundUpgrades = lootSystem.ProcessLootWithPodUpgrades(loot, inventory);

// Equip found upgrades
foreach (var upgrade in foundUpgrades)
{
    if (podComponent.EquipUpgrade(upgrade))
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Equipped: {upgrade.Name}");
    }
}
```

## Future Enhancements

The pod system is designed to be extensible. Future additions may include:

1. **More Skills**: Specialized skills for different playstyles
2. **Skill Specializations**: Choose between different skill tree paths
3. **More Abilities**: Expand ability pool with unique effects
4. **Pod Customization**: Visual customization options
5. **Multiple Pods**: Managing a fleet of specialized pods
6. **Pod Trading**: Trading or selling pods with rare upgrades
7. **Enhanced Docking**: Multiple docking modes (pilot, passenger, storage)
8. **Ability Crafting**: Combine abilities to create new ones

## Game Design Philosophy

The pod system creates a unique progression mechanic where:
- **The player character has tangible in-game form** (not abstract)
- **Character progression directly impacts gameplay** (level, skills, abilities)
- **Rare loot has meaningful purpose** (upgrades and ability unlocks)
- **Ship building integrates with character** (docking port requirement)
- **Risk/reward is balanced** (pod can be destroyed, upgrades lost)
- **Deep customization** (skill trees, abilities, upgrades combine for unique builds)

This makes every ship you pilot feel personal, every upgrade you find valuable, every skill you learn meaningful, and every ability you unlock exciting, while maintaining the core Avorion-like ship building experience.
